#  Probability and Statistics: Analysis of Computer Parts (CPUs, GPUs, and ICs)  

##  Overview  
This project applies **probability and statistical analysis** techniques to study data related to **computer components**, including **CPUs**, **GPUs**, and **Integrated Circuits (ICs)**. The goal is to **analyze trends**, **identify patterns**, and **draw insights** from real-world hardware data.  

##  Features  
-  **Data Analysis**: Investigates specifications, performance metrics, and market data of computer parts.  
-  **Statistical Techniques**: Applies measures like **mean**, **variance**, **correlation**, and **regression analysis**.  
-  **Probability Models**: Evaluates likelihoods and distributions of hardware characteristics.  
-  **Visualizations**: Generates **charts**, **histograms**, and **scatter plots** for better data interpretation.  

##  Key Insights  
- **Performance Trends**: Analysis of how CPUs and GPUs evolved over time.  
- **Price-to-Performance Ratio**: Statistical evaluation of cost efficiency across product lines.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies relationships between clock speed, core count, and power consumption.  

##  Tools & Libraries  
- **Python**: Main language for data analysis and modeling.  
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computation.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Creating clear and informative visualizations.
